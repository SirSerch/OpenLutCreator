Create LUTS with your Lightroom presets or Photoshop color edits and use them in Premiere or any program that accepts LUTS in .cube format

It's simple, just generate a HALD, apply the preset to them, export and generate the .cube

[This video](https://vimeo.com/171039282) can solve some of the questions you have about the process, the video is from another app, but the process are the same.

There're more programs what can do the same, and maybe half of the size, but this is open source and you can learn and see how a LUT o CUBE format works
